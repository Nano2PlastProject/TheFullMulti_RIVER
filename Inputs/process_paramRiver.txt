#input file containing process information for given MPs
#file containing data to parameterise different rate processes
#
#
#Parameters
#River compartments: 1-Surface water, 2-Flowing water, 3-Stagnant water, 4-Sediment 
#aggState: A-free MPs, B-Heteroaggregated MPs-SPM, C-Biofouled MPs-BF, D-Heteroaggregated biofouled MP-BF-SPM
#alpha: attachment efficiency of the MP to SPM
#t_half_d: degradation half-life of MP in days
#k_frag_d: fractionation rate of the Mp in day-1
#t_biof_growth_d: time for the biofilm coverage to growon the Mp surface in days
